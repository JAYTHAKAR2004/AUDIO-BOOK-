The Glory of India

Let’s raise the honor of Mother India high,
Spread love in every corner of the sky.
A song of unity in diversity we sing,
In every heart, let India’s love spring.

Mountains, rivers, seas so wide,
In every direction, India’s pride.
A land of culture, a history so grand,
India, the home of brave souls who stand.

The earth so lush, green, and bright,
In every flower, love shines its light.
Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada all flow,
Quenching thirst wherever they go.

Streams of faith, work, and knowledge run,
Guiding all beneath the sun.
In every village, every city near,
Waves of joy and peace appear.

Come, let’s light a lamp together,
Make India greater, now and forever.
Let this be every heart’s dream,
India, the world’s highest esteem.
